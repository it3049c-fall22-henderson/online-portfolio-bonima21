    <h2>
      About Me
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hello, My name is Mimi Boni. I was born in Ghana,Africa in the year 2000,
      but moved to the United States when I was 12; ever since then I've lived in Cincinnati,Ohio.
      I have one sibling.I went to Fairfield middle school then transferred to Northwest High school my freshman year.
      In high school I was involved in a lot of activities such as: varsity Tennis(2 years), Student senate(4 years),
      show choir(2 years), Key club(2 years),
      OAB(2 years) and the Butler Yech Cosmetology program. I finished high school with a 3.8 G.P.A with a certification
      in Cosmetology.
      My hobbies are dancing, singing (at my church choir) reading and traveling. If I had to decide myself, I would say
      that I am a very determined strong independent woman.
      I am very hardworking. I like everything I do to be well organized and I like to keep a positive attitude/mindset
      in almost every situation.
      I'm currently a Pre-Junior at the University of Cincinnati majoring in Software Development. I am currently a
      member of the nationa honor Soceity.
      In the near future I wish to make a career out of my major while traveling and enjoying the fine things in life.
    </p>
